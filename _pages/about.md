I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University advised by Dr. [Vladimir Braverman](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/vladimir-braverman/) and Dr. [Alex Szalay](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/alexander-szalay/). Previously, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis from Rice University. At Hopkins, I am also affiliated with the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP).

My research focuses on trustworthy large language models (LLMs) and medical machine learning. In the past, I have worked on LLM calibration, arrhythmia detection, and stroke prediction.
