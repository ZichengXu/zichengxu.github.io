I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. [Vladimir Braverman](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/vladimir-braverman/) and Dr. [Alex Szalay](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/alexander-szalay/). Previously, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis from Rice University. At Hopkins, I am also affiliated with the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP).

My research focuses on large language models (LLMs) inference time scaling and reasoning. In the past, I have also worked on medical machine learning, including arrhythmia detection and stroke prediction. If you are interested in these topics and would like to collaborate, you can reach me through email and I'm happy to chat!
